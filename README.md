This repository contains the 2024 version of my portfolio. 
It features a headless CMS built with React and Wordpress, which was styled with Tailwind CSS. A custom useFetch hook was incorporated to streamline the data fetching process. The goal was to blend a retro wave/neon style with a more moderate aesthetic while keeping it  fun and funky. I used custom JavaScript animations with the powerful GSAP library to create playfulness and went with bright accent colours and gradients for a synthwave tone.
